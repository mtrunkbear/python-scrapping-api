Choose the hygiene cycle for bedding and towels. It kills bacteria at 60\u00b0C so you have fresh sheets at night. If you're in a hurry, you can use the non-stop cycle for a small load. This washes and dries a pair of paints and a sweater in 1 hour. And the iSensoric sensors adjust the cycle to the amount of laundry. This way, it doesn't run longer than it needs to and saves energy.\n    "
